# santa-vs-grinch

A project made for a 24 hour hackathon.

It's a networked multiplayer game in Python where two players play Santa and the Grinch respectively and shoot presents and bombs at each other.
By no means amazing, but a good effort by myself, and my two teammates who had just recently learnt to program.

It won 2nd place out of 8 teams
